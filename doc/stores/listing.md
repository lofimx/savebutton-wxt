Save bookmarks, quotes, and images with Save Button

## Long Description

Save Button is a cross-browser, open-source, local-first bookmarking extension that saves your bookmarks, text quotes, and images locally and syncs them to your own server.

Click the toolbar button to bookmark any page. Right-click text or images to save them. Everything is stored locally in the browser and synced to your Save Button server over a simple HTTP API.

Features:
- One-click bookmarking from the toolbar
- Save text quotes and images from context menus
- Add notes to any bookmark
- Automatic sync with your Save Button server
- Works with Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Safari, and other Chromium-based browsers
- All data stored as plain files (bookmarks as .url, quotes as .md, metadata as .toml)
- No third-party analytics or tracking

An optional local daemon is available for users who want files mirrored to disk at ~/.kaya/. Visit https://savebutton.com for details.

## Privacy Policy Summary

Save Button does not collect, transmit, or store any user data on third-party servers. All bookmarks, quotes, and images are stored locally in the browser's sandboxed storage. If the user configures a Save Button server, data is synced only to that server using the credentials the user provides. No analytics, telemetry, or tracking of any kind is included in the extension.

## Permissions Justification

- **activeTab / tabs**: Reads the current tab URL and title to create bookmarks.
- **contextMenus**: Adds "Save to Kaya" options for saving selected text and images.
- **storage**: Stores extension preferences (server URL, email, password) in browser local storage.
- **notifications**: Displays error notifications to the user.
- **alarms**: Schedules periodic sync with the Save Button server (every 1 minute).
- **host_permissions (all URLs)**: Required to sync bookmarks, quotes, and images with the user's self-hosted Save Button server. The server URL is user-configurable, so the extension cannot know the domain in advance. Also used to fetch images from any website when the user saves an image via the context menu, and to communicate with an optional local daemon on localhost.
